# react-redux-demo
This is the first test app of mine. It does simple counting logic nothing much really simple.
Initially I have started with single component that holds the app structure inside component folder.
Inside App.js folder, I have rendered that component and also imported global redux store wrapping up with Provider.
redux folder has all kinds necessary redux startup like action types, action creators, reducers, and store.
